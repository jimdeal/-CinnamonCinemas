Overview from task:
You have a special task from Cinnamon Cinemas to develop a program to allocate seats to customers purchasing tickets for a movie theatre.
Cinnamon Cinemas provided some criteria for how the program should be built.

Initial project code set up to be followed by UML diagrams of proposed solution.

TDD will be approach taken.

Will be looking in to either 2D or nomral array representation of cinema seating.

Seats in representation to be shown as either unbooked OR a string showing name of who the seats are booked to

First version will book ticket as a block : ie: if a user requests 3 tickets - they will be booked together.
This does lead to a situation where the screen of 15 seats might only have three rows of three people.
